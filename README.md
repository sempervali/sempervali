### Hey there!

 I'm just a random Avali coder who works on projects in their spare time.
 See something you like? Contributions are appreciated, and especially would love to know how it has helped you

> Generally I work on passion projects, though some you see here may have been from my time in high school.
> I have mostly worked within Java; more recently I have begun tinkering with Python and (Bash) Shell Scripting.
> While I have worked on it in the past, I do NOT enjoy working on HTML, CSS, or Javascript. 

Should you need to reach me, I am available mostly on discord;
Username is rubintheflareon.
